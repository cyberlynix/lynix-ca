			I began my journey in IT back in 2013, where I started by learning basic
			HTML and C++ from university books. Since then, I've relied on resources
			like Google and YouTube to expand my knowledge and learn new programming
			languages. In 2022, I transitioned into the fields of System

			experiences. I've been constantly learning and I'm eager to continue
			growing in these areas. Currently, I'm in my second year of studying
			Cybersecurity in college. Aside from my IT pursuits, I also find
			enjoyment in VR gaming, and I proudly identify as a full-time furry.<br/>
