	<p class="text-gray-300 text-lg font-cyber mt-3 w-4/5">
		I began my journey in IT back in 2013, where I started by learning basic
		HTML and C++ from university books. Since then, I've relied on resources
		like Google and YouTube to expand my knowledge and learn new programming
		languages. In 2022, I transitioned into the fields of System
		Administration and Cybersecurity, which have been incredibly enriching
		experiences. I've been constantly learning and I'm eager to continue
		growing in these areas. Currently, I'm in my second year of studying
		Cybersecurity in college. Aside from my IT pursuits, I also find
		enjoyment in VR gaming, and I proudly identify as a full-time furry.

		Why <span class="text-green-700">Cybersecurity</span>?
	</h1>
	<p class="text-gray-300 text-lg font-cyber mt-3  w-4/5">
		In a constantly advancing technological world, ensuring the safety and
		security of our data has become increasingly crucial. I am passionate
		about contributing to the efforts that protect our valuable information.
		Each day, we come across news about cybersecurity exploits being
		discovered, and I aspire to be part of the community that proactively
		prevents such incidents. This is particularly critical for businesses,
		organizations, and individuals who rely on robust mitigation processes
		to safeguard their systems.
