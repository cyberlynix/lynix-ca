            As a Cybersecurity student, I'm actively seeking opportunities to
            enhance my knowledge and gain practical experience in the field. In
            addition to my studies, I have a passion for artistic expression and
            enjoy drawing in my free time. Playing video games is another interest
            of mine, which allows me to unwind and explore different virtual worlds.
            I'm proudly based in Canada, as indicated by my domain name being a .ca.

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg font-cyber mt-3">
            I began my journey in IT back in 2013, where I started by learning basic
            HTML and C++ from university books. Since then, I've relied on resources
            like Google and YouTube to expand my knowledge and learn new programming
            languages. In 2022, I transitioned into the fields of System
            Administration and Cybersecurity, which have been incredibly enriching
            experiences. I've been constantly learning and I'm eager to continue
            growing in these areas. Currently, I'm in my second year of studying
            Cybersecurity in college. Aside from my IT pursuits, I also find
            enjoyment in VR gaming, and I proudly identify as a full-time furry.

            Why <span class="text-cyan-600">Cybersecurity</span>?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg font-cyber  mt-3">
            In a constantly advancing technological world, ensuring the safety and
            security of our data has become increasingly crucial. I am passionate
            about contributing to the efforts that protect our valuable information.
            Each day, we come across news about cybersecurity exploits being
            discovered, and I aspire to be part of the community that proactively
            prevents such incidents. This is particularly critical for businesses,
            organizations, and individuals who rely on robust mitigation processes
            to safeguard their systems.
